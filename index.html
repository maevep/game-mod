GAMEPLAY The shortest player goes first. Play then passes to the left. On your turn, flip over one card. The next card you flip over must be a color and number match. If it isn't, it's the next player's turn. If it is a match, then move your Gingerbread Character pawn as directed below. Your turn is over. Remove the cards you flipped, and keep them for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
CARDS When you draw cards that match in color and have one square on each, move your pawn forward toward the Candy Castle to the first matching color space on the path.
When you draw cards that match in color and have two squares on each, move your pawn forward toward the Candy Castle to the second matching color space on the path.
When you draw a Picture card, you must pick up each player's Gingerbread Characters except your own. You must then attempt to balance all three Characters on top of eachother. If any Character falls in the process, you must start back at the beginning. If they are succefully balanced, move your pawn forward or backward on the path to the PINK picture space on the board that matches the PINK picture square on your card. For example, if you draw an ICECREAM card, move your pawn to the pink space on the board that shows the icecream cone.

MOVEMENT 1. Always move in the direction of the signposts unless a Picture card directs you to move backwards on the path. 2. Two or more Gingerbread Character pawns may be on the same space at the same time, however they must be balanced. Whoever knocks them over must move back one space. 3. Shortcuts: There are 3 shortcuts on the path. If your Gingerbread Character pawn lands on one, you can make the shortcut immediately by moving your pawn to the space ahead. In the case of the green spaces with white arrows, you may move one ahead. In the case of the first blue square, you may travel up the river on the board to the orange square above it.
3. 'X' spaces: There are 2 'X' spaces on the path. If you land on one of these spaces by exact count, your Gingerbread Character is stuck there for one turn.
